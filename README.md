# 🔒 Instagram password encryption reverse-engineering.

here is one project of my favourite hobby (reverse engineering), today I attacked Instagram and their password encryption function. That was really super simple, like a 5 y/o kid can do it ngl.

## 💭 TODO

- **keyId**: find how to make it not static.

- **publicKey**: find how to generate it.

- **npm**: make it a npm module.

- **full client**: make a full instagram reverse engineering, and create a client.

## 🚦 Run the project

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal in the projects folder.
2. Edit password in `src/index.ts`.
3. Run `npm run dev` in same terminal.
